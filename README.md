# Git for Web Development Project
In this project you will be using the concepts learned in the Git for Web Development lesson to fork/clone/push/and submit a PR for each project during this sprint.

This project consists of two parts:

## Task 1: Set up Project
You will need to follow the Lambda School Git Workflow to add a file to this project follow the steps below:

- [ ] Create your own version of this repo - Fork
- [ ] Clone this repo
- [ ] Create a branch `git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'`
  - [ ] Add a file to the project called `yourFirstName-yourLastName`.txt. This should contain the link to your completed codepen from part 2 as well as the review questions/answers
  - [ ] Run your usual git commands for adding/committing and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [ ] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  - [ ] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> main).


## Task 2: MVP
1. fork this codepen https://codepen.io/BritHemming/pen/eYYEoPa?editors=1100
2. You will be marking up all of the HTML and styling it to look like this: https://codepen.io/BritHemming/full/jONmxOm using CSS
* this should be review from yesterday/ extra practice
3. After you are finished please copy the review questions into your .txt file and answer them
4. don't forget to add, commit and push your changes.


## Task 3: Stretch
Stretch Review questions: 
    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
Stretch Git Tasks
- [ ] While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independently research the following topics to learn more about Git.
  - [ ] Research and understand what a `merge conflict` is and how to resolve it.
  - [ ] Research the Git commands `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the main branch.
  - [ ] Research the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`. These commands will allow you to go back and amends previous commits you have made.

- [ ] Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console. 

- [ ] Research and setup SSH keys with GitHub, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push.

<div> <section> etc.
    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page?
You should use the same ID once per page. 
    10. What is a class?
A classifier that can be assigned to multiple elements.

$ ls
    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this?
Rm - but you should be careful with this because github saves your work and you don’t want to get rid of anything important before pushing it back at the risk of losing your work. 
    34. Why should I use version control? 
To go back to an earlier version of your project without having to start all over again.
    35. How often should I commit to github?
Often.
    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github?
Git push 
    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow.
First, fork the repo. Next, check if it’s yours. Third, clone the repo. Then, go to your directory in the terminal. Afterward, clone the repo into your terminal to make local changes and use cd to get into the repo. Create a branch using git checkout -b ‘firstName-lastName’. After the project is finished, use git add then git commit -m before using git-push to put everything on github. Finally, you make a pull request. 



Git Workflow: 

Checkout A Branch: 
- git checkout -b 'branch-name'

For Submissions
- git add . 
- git commit -m "Commit Message Goes Here"
- git push -u origin 'branch-name'
